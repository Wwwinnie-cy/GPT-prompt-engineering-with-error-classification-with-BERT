        "gpt_answer_1": "To find the least common multiple (LCM) of 135 and 468, we can start by finding the prime factorization of each number.\n\nFirst, let's find the prime factorization of 135:\n135 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 5 = 3^3 * 5\n\nNow, let's find the prime factorization of 468:\n468 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 13 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 13\n\nNext, we can find the LCM by taking the highest power of each prime factor that appears in either factorization. So the LCM of 135 and 468 is:\nLCM(135, 468) = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5 * 13 = 2340\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{2340}."

        "solution": "We want to square the equation in order to eliminate the radicals. To do so, we first move the $\\sqrt{x+\\frac4x}$ term to the right-hand side, giving \\[\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{x}} = 6 - \\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}}.\\]Now we see that squaring will produce lots of common terms on the left-hand and right-hand sides, which cancel: \\[\\begin{aligned}  \\\\ \\left(\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{x}}\\right)^2 &= \\left(6 - \\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}}\\right)^2 \\\\ x + 4 + \\frac 4x &= 36 - 12 \\sqrt{x + \\frac{4}{x}} + \\left(x + \\frac{4}{x}\\right) \\end{aligned}\\]which simplifies to $3\\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}} = 8.$ Squaring both sides, multiplying, and rearranging gives the quadratic \\[9x^2 - 64x + 36 = 0.\\]By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of this quadratic is $\\boxed{\\frac{64}{9}}.$\n\nTo be complete, we must check that both of these roots satisfy the original equation. There are two steps in our above solution which could potentially not be reversible: squaring the equation \\[\\sqrt x + \\sqrt{\\frac 4x} = 6 - \\sqrt{x+\\frac 4x},\\]and squaring the equation \\[3\\sqrt{x+\\frac 4x} = 8.\\]To check that these steps are reversible, we need to make sure that both sides of the equations in both steps are nonnegative whenever $x$ is a root of $9x^2-64x+36=0.$ This quadratic is equivalent to $x+\\frac4x=\\frac{64}{9},$ so $6-\\sqrt{x+\\frac4x}=6-\\sqrt{\\frac{64}{9}}=\\frac{10}{3},$ which is positive, and $3\\sqrt{x+\\frac{4}{x}} = 3\\sqrt{\\frac{64}{9}} = 8,$ which is also positive. Therefore, all our steps were reversible, so both roots of the quadratic satisfy the original equation as well.",

        "solution": "To find the maximum height of the ball is to maximize the expression $-16t^2+80t+21$. We will do this by completing the square. Factoring a $-16$ from the first two terms, we have  \\[-16t^2+80t+21=-16(t^2-5t)+21\\]To complete the square, we add and subtract $(-5/2)^2=6.25$ inside the parenthesis to get \\begin{align*}\n-16(t^2-5t)+21&=-16(t^2-5t+6.25-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16([t-2.5]^2-6.25)+21\\\\\n&=-16(t-2.5)^2+121\n\\end{align*}Since $-16(t-2.5)^2$ is always non-positive, the maximum value of the expression is achieved when $-16(t-2.5)^2=0$, so the maximum value is $0+121=\\boxed{121}$ feet.",
