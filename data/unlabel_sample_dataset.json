        "solution": "A positive integer is a factor of $2^4\\cdot7^9$ if and only if its prime factorization is of the form $2^a\\cdot 7^b$ for exponents $a$ and $b$ satisfying $0\\leq a \\leq 4$ and $0\\leq b\\leq 9$.  A positive integer is a perfect square if and only if the exponents in its prime factorization are even.  A positive integer is even if and only if the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization is at least 1.  Therefore, we may choose $a=2$ or $4$ and $b=0,$ $2,$ $4,$ $6,$ or $8.$  Since we have 2 choices for $a$ and 5 choices for $b$, there are $2\\times5=\\boxed{10}$ ways to make these two decisions.",

A perfect square factor is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.\n\nFor a number to be a perfect square factor, the exponents of all its prime factors must be even.\n\nIn this case, the perfect square factors can be formed by choosing even exponents for both 2 and 7.\n\nFor 2, the possible even exponents are 0, 2, and 4.\nFor 7, the possible even exponents are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n\nSo, the number of even perfect square factors is the product of the number of choices for each prime factor.\n\nThe number of even perfect square factors is 3 (choices for 2) * 5 (choices for 7) = 15.\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{15}."

        "solution": "In $f(x)$, all terms will have a multiple of $x$ except for the constant term, which is the multiple of the four constants $3,2,7$, and $13$.\n\nRecall (from the Euclidean algorithm) that the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ is the same as the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $a-kb$ where $k,a,$ and $b$ are any integers. Therefore, finding the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is the same as finding the greatest common divisor of $x$ and the constant term of $f(x)$. Therefore, we want to find \\begin{align*}\n\\text{gcd}\\,((2x+3)(7x+2)(13x+7)(x+13),x) &=\\text{gcd}\\,(2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 13, x)\\\\\n&=\\text{gcd}\\,(546,x).\n\\end{align*}Since $23478$ is a multiple of $546$, the greatest common divisor of $f(x)$ and $x$ is $\\boxed{546}$.",
